# TODO


## task list

- scene-tab right-click context menu does not disappear when I click away from it
- double-clicking on a scene tab should start a scene rename operation
- in the rename-scene popup dialog, text should start highlighted, so I can just type the new name immediately
- Add a 'New...' submenu in the scene right-click context menu, to create new text and prompt objects
- fix 'gemini imagen' and 'gemini flash imagen' names. They should be "Gemini Nanobana" and "Gemini Nanobana Pro". Make sure the order is right, ie the pro model is identified correctly.
- If a least one image is selected when running the ImageGen prompt, the generated image should have it's scale set so it appears the same width/height as the input image (whichever is larger)
