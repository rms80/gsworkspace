## Undo/redo functionality

This app will have a persistent undo/redo system, that tracks changes in the scene using deltas or "change" objects/records.
The history stack will be serialized in a "sidecar" file history.json adjacent to the main scene.json.
The change history will be restored when the scene is loaded.
Each scene has it's own history, and undo/redo only affects the currently active scene.

Change records should be relatively minimal, ie there should be 'add_object', 'delete_object',
'transform_object' (for translation/scaling/rotation), 'update_text' for text edits, and any
others that make sense in context.

The undo and redo steps for each change record should be implemented separately, as
code that implements a generic change-record interface. The history record should store
the info about which object it applies to. The main app will pass the scene to the history
record implementation and it will do the updating as needed. 

- [ ] create a new branch for this feature in github and switch to that branch
- [ ] create separate files for the history system, in a subfolder /history
- [ ] define an interface for history change records and the history system
- [ ] Implement creating the history stack for the current scene in the main app
- [ ] Implement the different types of change records and add them to the history in the right place
- [ ] Implement serializing the history stack, and restoring it on load
- [ ] Add undo/redo buttons to the Toolbar
- [ ] Implement Ctrl+Z (undo) and Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z (redo) keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Truncate the History when a change is made while at some previous history state (IE normal undo history behaviour)
- [ ] Create a Pull Request for this new feature branch
